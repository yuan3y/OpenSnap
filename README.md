A PHP Mysql server API for OpenSnap
====================================
This is an ongoing work for our Software Engineering Project.

All codes are our own original work unless otherwise indicated.

Feel free to fork this project & host it on your own server.

Do note that this API is meant to be simple and hastle-free for the school project, 
the password is NOT encrypted at all. Do change that when you decide to fork it for realworld use.

[This API usage reference is available at github](https://github.com/yuan3y/OpenSnap/blob/master/API%20Usage.md )
